## 🎸 Origin & Credit

- This multi-agent system was designed and built in collaboration with Claude (Anthropic) during a sleep-deprived holiday sprint in late 2025. The architecture emerged from a conversation about how agent swarms could be adapted for creative development workflows — specifically, how to take the general concept and make it actually useful for building weird, wonderful, non-monetizable projects.
If you find this useful, that's the dream. Go make something fun with it.
